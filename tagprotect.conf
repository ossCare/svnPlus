#
#  The parsing script will built an 'N-Tuple' from each
#  'PROTECTED_PARENT' variable.
#
# Recognized variable/value pairs are:
#   These are for debugging and the svnlook path
#          DEBUG		= N
#          SVNPATH		= path to svn
#          SVNLOOK		= path to svnlook
#   These make up an N-Tuple
#          PROTECTED_PARENT		= /<path>
# e.g.:    PROTECTED_PRJDIRS	= /<path>/*
# or e.g.: PROTECTED_PRJDIRS	= /<path>/*/*
#          PRJDIR_CREATORS	= '*' or '<user>, <user>, ...'
#          ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY	= <name>


### These should be first
DEBUG             = 0
SVNPATH           = "/usr/bin/svn"
SVNLOOK           = "/usr/bin/svnlook"


### These comprise an N-Tuple, can be repeated as many times as wanted,
### but each PROTECTED_PARENT value must be unique.   It is not allowed to
### try to configure the same folder twice (or more)!
PROTECTED_PARENT  = "/tags"          # must be literal
PROTECTED_PRJDIRS = "/tags/*"
PRJDIR_CREATORS   = "*"
ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY = "Archive"
